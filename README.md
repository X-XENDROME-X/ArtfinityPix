# ArtfinityPix - Image Generator App

## Description
ArtfinityPix is a simple image generator app that allows users to select a category and generate a random image from that category. The app uses the Unsplash API to fetch high-quality images and displays them in the app's GUI. Users can also download the displayed image to their device.

## Features
- Choose from various categories such as Food, Animals, People, Music, Art, Vehicles, and more.
- Click on the "Generate Image" button to fetch a random image from the selected category.
- The image is displayed in the app's GUI, providing a preview of the chosen image.
- Click on the "Download" button to save the displayed image to your device's Downloads folder.

## About
I created ArtfinityPix as a high school project to learn and practice Python programming and GUI development using the `tkinter` library. The app demonstrates how to interact with an API, display images in a GUI, and handle user interactions. Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own projects.
